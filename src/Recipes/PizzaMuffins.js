          <h1>Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza Muffins</h1>
          <p>
            Put down the fork and knife… here's a Chicago deep-dish pizza that
            you can actually eat by holding it in your hands! A beautiful golden
            crust contains a meaty, cheesy, saucy filling with Italian sausage,
            sweet peppers, and 3 types of cheese. The sauce and cheese char
            slightly on the outside as they bake, resulting in a super savory
            taste.

                Skip To Recipe We've all heard the old saying, "if you don't
                like something, try a much smaller version of it." And I don't
                think there's a better example than these Chicago deep-dish
                pizza "muffins." Okay, so that's not really an old saying, but
                maybe it should be, since this fun-size version has changed how
                I feel about CDDP.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm not one of these lunatic New Yorkers who has a visceral
                hatred for deep-dish pizza, but it's generally not something I
                crave, or seek out. If I'm in Chicago, and you're buying, I'd
                happily join you for a nice slice, or wedge, or slab, or
                whatever you people call it, but let's just say it wouldn't be
                my first choice.

                Besides the superior texture, the perfect crust-to-filling
                ratio, and that you can hold them in your hand like real pizza,
                what I like so much about these, is that we can do lots of
                different ingredient combinations in the same pan. Do you love
                sausage, but your better half would prefer mushrooms and peppers
                instead? With this easy and fun technique, that's easily
                do-able. But no matter how diverse you make yours, I really hope
                you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

                  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Generously

                  Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8
                  inch. Pick it up from the edges to make sure it's not stuck to
                  the surface, then cut out twelve 4-inch circles. Reroll the
                  dough to cut all 12 circles if necessary.

                  getting close to, but not all the way up to the top. When all
                  circles have been placed in the muffin pan, go around one more
                  time to push and press on each one.

                  Put 1 tablespoon provolone cheese into each cup, followed by 1
                  tablespoon cooked sausage and 2 teaspoons cooked peppers.
                  Lightly press on the fillings to compress, then top with 1
                  rounded tablespoon mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons pizza
                  sauce, pushing the sauce down gently into the fillings; it's
                  okay that the fillings will be slightly higher than the pan.
                  Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese generously over top.

                  Make sure the dough is cold since it will make it easier to
                  work with and prevent it from rising too soon. Try the dough
                  from my Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza recipe. Half a batch will be
                  enough for this recipe, or use the whole batch and double this
                  for 24 muffins.

                  You can make these ahead for a party. After Step 6, cool to
                  room temperature, then cover and refrigerate. Before your
                  party, pop them on a sheet pan and put them in a preheated 350
                  degree F (175 degree C) oven until heated through, about 15
